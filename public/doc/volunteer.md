### A **student volunteer** is one of the most important parts of a data driven project such as Asquire. As a student volunteer, you are supposed to coordinate with the contributors and guide them to perform a very clean and useful recording.

### Each student volunteer is required to get a total of **45 contributors for the project**, for which he/she will be awarded a sum of Rs 5000/-, the student volunteer is supposed to compensate the contributors with Rs 100 each out of this sum. If interested, he/she can also help the back-end team to validate this data, hence getting a hands on experience
